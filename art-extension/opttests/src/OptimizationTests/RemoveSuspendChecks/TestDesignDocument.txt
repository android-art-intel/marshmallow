	The pass only applies to certain parts of loops:	
	- The number of times the loop is execute is known at compile time (i.e. the loop must have constant bounds).	
	- The loop must not call a method, or execute a statement that may throw an exception (such as new, throw)	
	- The loop must not contain a return or an array length.	
	- The loop must be the inner loop	
	- The cost of the loop (total estimated instruction cost * number of iterations) must be less than 100000 (one million).	
	- A multiplication has a cost of 5	
	- A division or remainder has a cost of 50	
	- All other instructions have a cost of 1	
		
	No negative tests are needed (due to the doc)	
	Do/while loops and For loops behave differently by desigh: Bound checks are not removed while BCE pass (this is Google pass)
